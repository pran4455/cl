🔑 What this code does

This code simulates a Token Ring algorithm for distributed mutual exclusion.

Processes (nodes) are connected in a ring topology.

Only the process holding the token can enter the Critical Section (CS).

After finishing, the node passes the token to the next node in the ring.

This ensures that only one process can access the shared resource at a time.

================================

CCA
The coordinator ensures mutual exclusion - only one client can be in the critical section at a time, with fair FIFO queuing for multiple requests.

MPS

A Critical Section is a part of a program where a process (or thread) accesses shared resources (like a file, database, or variable) that must not be accessed by more than one process at the same time.
This code makes 3 processes coordinate to safely enter a shared resource (Critical Section) using Ricart–Agrawala algorithm:

Before entering, each node asks permission from others.

Others reply if they are not using it or if their request is later.

Only when it has all permissions, it enters CS.

After leaving, it replies to all pending requests.

=======================================
- It’s a tiny RMI demo using Pyro4: a remote `Calculator` object is exposed by a server, and a client calls its methods over the network.

What each file does
- `calc.py`: Defines and exposes `Calculator` via `@Pyro4.expose` with `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div` (division returns a message on error).
- `server.py`: Starts a Pyro4 daemon, registers `Calculator`, and registers it in the name server under `ex2.calculator`, then serves requests.
- `client.py`: Looks up `ex2.calculator` in the name server, creates a `Pyro4.Proxy`, and invokes `add/sub/mul/div` on 10 and 12.
